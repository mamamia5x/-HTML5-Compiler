# HTML5 Compiler
The one thing I've always wanted to make was a compiler. I first tried with PHP, it worked well and did the job. But it was ugly and nothing special. You can find it [here](https://github.com/mamamia5x/Old-HTML5-Compiler). 

My goal is to make it web based, but also work if you download it. The old one worked online, but the site would write it to the same global file.

The Beta site, which is where I test new features, can be found [here](https://HTML-JS-CSS-Compiler.mamamia5x.repl.co).

The lastest relase, which you can use to download and run the project offline, can be found [https://github.com/mamamia5x/HTML5-Compiler/releases](here)
