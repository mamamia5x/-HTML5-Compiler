# HTML5 Compiler
The one thing I've always wanted to make was a compiler. I first tried with PHP, it worked well and did the job. But it was ugly and nothing special. You can find it [here](https://github.com/mamamia5x/Old-HTML5-Compiler). 

My goal is to make it web based, but also work if you download it. The old one worked online, but the site would write it to the same global file.
